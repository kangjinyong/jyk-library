# Introduction

This project is where I work on components which I find useful in various applications, built on top of Angular Material

# Getting Started

Import 'jyk-library'.

Refer to StackBlitz link on how to use the library.

# Components

1. Responsive table.

As the screen size resizes, the table responds by displaying less columns, collapsing others into the mat-expansion-panel content.
